# President Joe Biden's $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) relief bill to help Americans deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has cleared its final hurdle in Congress.

The House of Representatives approved the massive economic aid plan 220-211 on Wednesday along partisan lines, with no Republicans voting in favour.

Having already passed through the Senate, the relief package now heads to Mr Biden's desk to be signed into law.

This sixth Covid-19 relief bill is a major legislative win for Mr Biden.

The bill passed with all but one House Democrat voting in favour.

White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said the president will sign the bill into law on Friday.

The bill "is about giving the backbone of this nation - the essential workers, the working people who built this country, the people who keep this country going - a fighting chance" Mr Biden said.

He later vowed to share any surplus Covid-19 vaccines globally after ensuring that Americans are immunised. "If we have a surplus, we're going to share it with the rest of the world," he said.
